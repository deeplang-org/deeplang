 *
 * @brief This log system supports wrapping multiple outputs into one
 * log message.  This is useful for outputting variable-length logs
 * without additional memory overhead (the buffer for concatenating
 * the message), e.g. exception stack trace, which cannot be printed
 * by a single log calling without the help of an additional buffer.
 * Avoiding additional memory buffer is useful for resource-constraint
 * systems.  It can minimize the impact of log system on applications
 * and logs can be printed even when no enough memory is available.
 * Functions with prefix "_" are private functions.  Only macros that
 * are not start with "_" are exposed and can be used.
